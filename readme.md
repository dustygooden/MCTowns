# MCTowns

MCTowns is a town management plugin for Minecraft Survivial Multiplayer servers running an implementation of the Bukkit API.

It is inspired somewhat by Towny in that it aims to be a much more flexible town management system, allowing free-form regions of many different types. It is built on top of WorldGuard and WorldEdit, using their powerful region selection and management tools for its own regions.

See the wiki for more information and detailed usage instructions.
